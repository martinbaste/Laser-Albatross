##Done

* Support for multiple input and output formats
* Print rejected blocks
* Print accepted and rejected block ranges
* Support for gaps
* Support for HTML output
* HTML output shows which blocks have been removed



##Todo


* Add new filtering algorithms
* Refactor code
* Add partial gap support: don't consider them as a valid character (they don't count towards the conserved or non conserved calculation of the position)
* Maybe have both alignments in the html scroll at the same time.
* Maybe add score/information content/conservation info to HTML
* Info-score info added as a new track
* Maybe integrate with bash pipes? check emboss
* Add support for ambiguous characters
* Check that it works for nucleotides
* Add polydot chart?
